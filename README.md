# Chef
Chef is a bot that generates recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Built using UiPath and OpenAI's API, Chef makes it easy to cook at home using the ingredients you already have, without having to search through dozens of different recipes online.

# Project Overview
Our inspiration for creating Chef was to simplify the cooking process for people who want to eat well but don't always have the time or energy to spend on meal planning. We wanted to make it easier for people to cook at home using the ingredients they already have on hand, rather than resorting to takeout or fast food.

Chef is built using UiPath's automation platform to create the interface for the bot, and connected it to OpenAI's API to generate the recipe. The user inputs the ingredients they have available, and the bot uses machine learning algorithms to generate a recipe that uses those ingredients. Chef then presents the recipe to the user, along with instructions for how to make it.

# Technologies Used
UiPath
OpenAI API
Python
# Getting Started
To get started with Chef, you'll need to have UiPath installed on your computer. Once you have UiPath installed, you can download the source code for Chef from this Github repository.

# Usage
To use Chef, simply run the UiPath project and input the ingredients you have on hand. The bot will generate a recipe based on those ingredients, which you can then use to make a delicious meal.
